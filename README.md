This is a project I've worked on a long time ago using the Tensorflow Object Detection API.
I trained a model to recognize hand signs from Naruto, then used them as a control scheme to play Pac-Man and Snake:

I followed a series of tutorials created by Nicholas Renotte on YouTube. His videos were very helpful.
Here is the original videos for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqkISICHH-U&t=4350s&ab_channel=NicholasRenotte and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTSRZt04JkY&ab_channel=NicholasRenotte

DISCLAIMER: 

Working on my TensorFlow object detection project was pretty rough, especially with all the dependency issues. 
I had so many problems with version mismatches – like, the TensorFlow Object Detection API needed a specific version to work with a certain version of Python. It felt like a mess.
There were times I thought I had everything set up right, only to find out that I had the wrong versions installed, and everything broke.
Fixing these issues was like trying to solve a puzzle. I had to search through tons of forums, documentation, and error logs, tweaking things until they finally worked.
I also tried to create a requirements.txt file so others wouldn’t have to deal with finding the right dependencies and versions. But honestly, I couldn’t figure it out completely.

Nonetheless, I am only positing this repo since I've been asked for it by some.
I doubt it'll be a good use if you're referencing it. I would suggest watching the tutorial videos I watched.
